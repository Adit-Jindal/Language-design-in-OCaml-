This contains the following operations:
Integers and Floats:
- a+b - Addition
- a-b - Subtraction
- a*b - Multiplication
- a/b - Division

Vectors:
- v+u - vector addition
- v-u - vector subtraction
- k*v - scalar multiplication (scalar comes first) (vector is not one of booleans)
- v.u - dot product
- |v| - magnitude (non-boolean vector)
- dim v - dimensions
- v^u - angle between vectors (non-boolean vector)
